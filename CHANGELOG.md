## 2.0.0

### Debouncer and Throttler Separation
Refactored the code to separate the responsibilities of debouncing and throttling for better code organization and maintainability. This separation enhances clarity and allows users to choose the appropriate mechanism based on their needs.

### Change to Named Parameters from Positional Parameters
Improved the method signature by switching from positional parameters to named parameters. This modification enhances code readability and makes it more user-friendly. Named parameters provide a clear and explicit way to convey the purpose of each argument, making the function calls more self-explanatory and reducing the likelihood of errors.
